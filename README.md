Welcome to SIQ BEETS

A project brought to you by Thaddeus Metz, Niko Sward and Daniel Sprague

Siq Beets is an audio playground that allows the user to make their own music without having any experience or knowledge of music creation.

We used React/Redux on the frontend and Express/Firebase on the backend.

We also used ToneJs for web audio manipulation.

Siq Beets is fully deployed and can be found at https://siqbeets.com/

Please check it out and feel free to reach out to us with any questions at wearesiqbeets@gmail.com

Thank you!
